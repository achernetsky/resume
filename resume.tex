\section{Diploma project}
\cvline{title}{\emph{Service to provide distributed locks and storage of configurations}}
\cvline{description}{Development of an service for obtaining distributed locks using \emph{RAFT} consensus algorithm was the goal of the diploma project. My work was based on the article ``In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm'' by Diego Ongaro and John Ousterhout presented in Stanford University. I received a high grade for my diploma project and was offered to continue education to receive second stage of higher education, as well as teach students at ``Computer science'' department.}

\cventry{}{Key developer of Gurtam routing service}{}{}{}{Development of service for computing optimal routes in road networks. I have developed so far the following key parts of system:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a construction of road graph from different sources (Polish Map Format, Shapefile format and OSM) and and merging them into a single unit;
  \item a preprocessing of Road Networks with Contraction Hierarchies;
  \item a shortest path computation in road networks with turn costs;
\end{itemize}}

\cventry{}{Key developer of Wialon apps}{}{}{}{I have implemented a few applications. Among them are Driving Logbook, Dashboard, Gurtam Maps and iDriveSafe IQ. They are implemented using Wialon Hosting and Wialon Kit SDKs. Driving Logbook allows requesting reports/a report for a unit's trips with an opportunity of adjusting trip status and making user's notes. Dashboard provides overview of fleet KPIs (key performance indicators) in an easy to read real-time user interface to enable instantaneous and informed decisions to be made at a glance. Gurtam Maps can be used in two ways: to search location and address by given coordinates and to search location and coordinates by given address or its part. iDriveSafe IQ is a comprehensive driving quality control system that allows to evaluate drivers’ behavior and the way they treat their vehicles.}
